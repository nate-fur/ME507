/** @file task_brightness.h
 *    This file contains the header for a task class that controls the brightness of an
 *    LED using a voltage measured from the A/D as input. The fun part: the brightness
 *    that is being controlled can be on another AVR computer, with signals being sent
 *    and received via wireless transceivers. 
 *
 *  Revisions:
 *    @li 09-30-2012 JRR Original file was a one-file demonstration with two tasks
 *    @li 10-05-2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task
 *    @li 10-25-2012 JRR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task_sender
 *    @li 10-27-2012 JRR Altered from data sending task into LED blinking class
 *    @li 11-04-2012 JRR Altered again into the multi-task monstrosity
 *    @li 12-13-2012 JRR Yet again transmogrified; now it controls LED brightness
