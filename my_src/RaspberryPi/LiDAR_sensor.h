 * This class governs the control over the lidar device that is used for object detection around the semi-truck.
 * The planned model was the Hokuyo UBG-04LX-F01 Lidar (https://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/single.php?serial=164) but
 * due to the time constraints of this project, none of the actual implementation was completed for this class.
