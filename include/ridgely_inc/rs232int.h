/** \file rs232int.h
 *    This file contains a class which allows the use of a serial port on an AVR 
 *    microcontroller. This version of the class uses the serial port receiver 
 *    interrupt and a buffer to allow characters to be received in the background.
 *    The port is used in "text mode"; that is, the information which is sent and 
 *    received is expected to be plain ASCII text, and the set of overloaded left-shift 
 *    operators "<<" in emstream.* can be used to easily send all sorts of data 
 *    to the serial port in a manner similar to iostreams (like "cout") in regular C++. 
 *
 *  Revised:
 *    \li 04-03-2006 JRR For updated version of compiler
 *    \li 06-10-2006 JRR Ported from C++ to C for use with some C-only projects; also
 *        serial_avr.h now has defines for compatibility among lots of AVR variants
 *    \li 08-11-2006 JRR Some bug fixes
 *    \li 03-02-2007 JRR Ported back to C++. I've had it with the limitations of C.
 *    \li 04-16-2007 JO  Added write (unsigned long)
 *    \li 07-19-2007 JRR Changed some character return values to bool, added m324p
 *    \li 01-12-2008 JRR Added code for the ATmega128 using USART number 1 only
 *    \li 02-14-2008 JRR Split between emstream and rs232 files
 *    \li 05-31-2008 JRR Changed baud calculations to use CPU_FREQ_MHz from Makefile
 *    \li 06-01-2008 JRR Added getch_tout() because it's needed by 9Xstream modems
 *    \li 07-05-2008 JRR Changed from 1 to 2 stop bits to placate finicky receivers
 *    \li 12-22-2008 JRR Split off stuff in base232.h for efficiency
 *    \li 06-30-2009 JRR Received data interrupt and buffer added

/** \brief This class controls a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), 
 *  a common asynchronous serial interface used in microcontrollers, and allows the
 *  use of an overloaded \c << operator to print things in \c cout style. 
 * 
 *  \details It talks to old-style RS232 serial ports (through a voltage converter chip 
 *  such as a MAX232) or through a USB to serial converter such as a FT232RL chip. The 
 *  UART (or USART on a newer AVR chip) is also sometimes used to communicate directly 
 *  with other microcontrollers, sensors, or wireless modems. 
 * 
 *  In the version in files \c rs232int.* this class installs an interrupt service
 *  routine (ISR) for receiving characters. When characters arrive in the UART, they
 *  are placed in a buffer whose size is configurable with the macro \c RSINT_BUF_SIZE.
 *  Calls to \c getchar() will check the buffer for received characters. This method,
 *  as opposed to polling the receiver without using interrupts, allows much higher
 *  data rates to be reliably supported in a multitasking program. Sending of 
 *  characters is currently not interrupt based. 
 * 
 *  \section Usage
 *  To create and use a serial port driver object requires only code such as the
 *  following:
 *  \code
 *  rs232 ser_port (9600, 0);
 *  ser_port << "Hello from test program number " << prog_num << endl;
 *  \endcode
 *  The first parameter to the \c rs232 constructor is the baud rate; 9600 is by far 
 *  the most commonly used. The second parameter is the USART number; use 0 for AVR's
 *  which have only one UART or USART. On AVR's which have a second USART, it is
 *  possible to have two \c rs232 objects, one on USART 0 and one on USART 1. 
 *  The third USART on some AVR's is currently not supported until the author gets a
 *  three-USART chip on which to test new code.
