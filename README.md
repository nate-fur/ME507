# ME507

This README should be found in the root directory of the project ME 507. 

All of the source files that were written by our team (each of the different tasks and the main functions that run on the raspberry pi and atmega64) are found in the my_src folder. main_mega.cpp runs on the atmega dn main_pi.cpp runs on the raspberry pi.

The borrowed_code folder located in the root of this project has code used from other sources, including Dr. Ridgely for avr code, hokuyoaist-master's lidar driver, Servo code from Arduino and Adafruits BNO055 driver.
