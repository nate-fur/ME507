\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class governs the control over the lidar device that is used for object detection around the semi-\/truck. The planned model was the Hokuyo U\+B\+G-\/04\+L\+X-\/\+F01 Lidar (\href{https://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/single.php?serial=164}{\tt https\+://www.\+hokuyo-\/aut.\+jp/search/single.\+php?serial=164}) but due to the time constraints of this project, none of the actual implementation was completed for this class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
Li\+D\+A\+R\+\_\+sensor.\+h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
