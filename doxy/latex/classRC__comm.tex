\subsection{Detailed Description}
Created by nate furbeyre on 11/18/18 The RC comm task handles the reception of data from the remote device that the user can control the semi truck with. It is able to change the desired output for the gear shifter task and the fifth wheel task. In addition takes in data that changes the setpoints for the motor and steering servo that are relayed to the control loop also running on the raspberry pi. This is another class that was not implemented due to the time constraints of the class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
