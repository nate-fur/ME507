 * Created by nate furbeyre on 11/18/18
 * The RC comm task handles the reception of data from the remote device that the
 * user can control the semi truck with. It is able to change the desired output
 * for the gear shifter task and the fifth wheel task. In addition takes in data
 * that changes the setpoints for the motor and steering servo that are relayed
 * to the control loop also running on the raspberry pi. This is another class
 * that was not implemented due to the time constraints of the class.
